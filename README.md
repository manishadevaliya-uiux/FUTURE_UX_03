# 📊 CRM Dashboard UI

### SaaS Product Concept for a Digital Marketing Agency

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

This project presents a scalable CRM dashboard concept designed for a growing digital marketing agency managing SEO, Paid Ads, Social Media, and Web Development clients.

The objective was to design a workflow-driven SaaS interface that centralizes:

* Lead acquisition & pipeline tracking
* Client lifecycle management
* Revenue visibility & forecasting
* Task and follow-up execution
* Performance analytics

Rather than focusing only on visuals, this dashboard is structured around real operational workflows used in service-based B2B agencies.

## 🏢 Business Context

Target Organization:
A 5-member digital marketing agency managing 30+ active clients and ongoing inbound leads.

Key Stakeholders:

* Agency Owner (Revenue & KPI monitoring)
* Sales Executive (Lead conversion tracking)
* Account Manager (Client communication & engagement)
* Operations Team (Task & deadline management)

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Many small-to-mid agencies operate using fragmented tools such as spreadsheets, messaging platforms, and disconnected task managers. This leads to:

* Missed follow-ups
* Scattered client information
* Poor visibility into pipeline health
* Limited revenue forecasting capability

This CRM dashboard addresses those inefficiencies by centralizing operational data into a structured, scalable system.

## 🏗 Information Architecture Strategy

The navigation reflects the natural service workflow:

Lead → Proposal → Client → Task Execution → Revenue Monitoring

Each sidebar module represents an operational stage, reducing cognitive load and improving task clarity.
